# NovaBuilder Documentation

This directory contains all **official documentation, audits, specifications and internal references**
for the NovaBuilder ecosystem.

It is intentionally structured to support:

- Long-term maintainability
- Evidence-based development
- Security, compliance & auditability
- Clear separation between developer-facing and release-facing artefacts

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

The documentation structure is intentionally introduced **incrementally**.

Sections will be added as they reach a stable, reviewable and verifiable state,
to avoid outdated or speculative documentation.

---

## 📌 Documentation Principles

- Documentation follows implementation, not the other way around
- No placeholders, no assumptions
- Every document must answer *why*, not just *what*
- Historical context is preserved when relevant
